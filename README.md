# Cleaning-Tidying-Data---Week-4-assignment

This script has been written as part of Coursera assignment for Cleaning & Tidying Data Week 4, which is the 3rd block (out of 10) of the Data Science Specialisation track provided by John Hopkins University.

In the parent repository, there are 3 files:

1)CODEBOOK.md --> this is a detail R scrip with comments that has been used to tidy, cleanup and reshape the data.

2)output.txt --> this is the final outout of the scrip - the tidy data. As a check, it has 180 rows and 82 columns (plus a header)

3)README.md --> the file you are reading now :)

Codebook has been commented extensively, so the scrip should be easy to understand. 

A few general notes:

-Script has been written on a MAC. If you run it on Windows, you might have to remove / modify method="curl" in the download line

-Data source - URL in the first line of the script is as provided on Coursera website assignment instructions page

-Column selection - as there were no further instructions, the final output shows all columns where the label was containing "mean" or "std"

-Prerequisites to run this script are "dplyr" and "reshape2" packages, they have to be pre-installed before running the script

If you encounter any issues or problems understanding / running this script, I would greately appreciate if you could leave constructive feedback on Coursera.

Best,
Ignas
